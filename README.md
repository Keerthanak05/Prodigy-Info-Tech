Overview of the Project


Project : Text Generation with GPT-2

Objective:

The primary objective of this code is to generate text based on a given prompt using a fine-tuned version of the GPT-2 model. The generated text can be used for various applications, such as storytelling, creative writing, or generating conversational responses.

Key Activities:

*Model and Tokenizer Loading

*Setting the Padding Token

*Prompt Definition

*Text Encoding

*Text Generation

Technology Used:

*Libraries: The code uses the transformers library developed by Hugging Face, which provides implementations of various transformer-based models, including GPT-2.

*Model Architecture: GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) is a type of transformer model specifically designed for text generation tasks. It is trained on large text corpora and is capable of understanding and generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
